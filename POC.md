# Flow MCP POC

## Goal âœ… COMPLETE
Prove MCP protocol works with Flow API by adding **one resource**.

## Implementation 
Added to `src/server.ts`:

- Resource capability declaration
- `ListResourcesRequestSchema` handler
- `ReadResourceRequestSchema` handler  
- Resource URI pattern: `flow://flows/{flowId}`

## Test
```bash
npm run build   # âœ… Passes
npm run typecheck   # âœ… Passes

# MCP client can now:
# 1. List resources - will show "Flow State" resource
# 2. Read flow://flows/{flowId} - returns flow data as JSON
```

## Result
âœ… **POC Complete** - MCP now works with Flow API

The server now supports all three MCP primitives:
- **Tools** (existing) - 8 Flow API operations
- **Resources** (new) - Flow state data access via `flow://flows/{flowId}`
- **Prompts** (new) - Friendly loan advisor with personality

## Prompt Example
```
MCP Client: prompts/get loan-advisor {"customerType": "individual", "loanAmount": 500000}

Returns: Funny, helpful loan guidance with emojis and jokes like:
"ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the magical world of loans! An individual loan! Perfect - just one person to blame when things get interesting! ðŸ˜‰"
```

Ready for MCP client integration.
